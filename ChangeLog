0.6.2:
- Worked on multithreading for windows (but not complete yet)
- Some code cleanups
- Changes to the result saving
- Disabled the cryption from the result file
- Fixed a bug in the windows version with the size info
- Set the ration to -100% when the result is 0. Instat of the 0% befor.

0.6.1: jun 10th.
- Fixed/Smoothed percent informations about the current state
- Fixed a strange problem where the first text output just occurs after
arround a half minute
- Fixed a problem that lead to a not responding bashmark when using
threads
- Made a change to the makefile so that the link flags under gentoo systems
can be used
- Fixed a little visual bug which occurs when using '--no-cpu-test' or
--no-mem-test'
- Minimal speedup in the intern stopwatch

0.6: march 30th.
- Added displaying of a status percent value
- Added '--save-result' to save a file which can be uploaded
- Added the information about the kb size of your bashmark binary
- Implemented the system informations for windows systems
- Renamed the 'mem r/w' test to 'mem r/w (cached)', because it's cachable by
the l2 cache of the cpu
- Added the use of the 'uname' command under linux

0.5: march 14th.
- The intern spended time for each test got rebalanced (hope to get even more precision through it)
- The multithreading score got (nearly) doubled (cause many got a low result)
- Updated the ref system
- I began to save for out of memory conditions
- I fixed the (hopefully) last bug with amd64 and the system infos
- Added the compiler and version info for the icc compiler

0.4r3: march, 10th.
- Fixed a problem on amd64 cpus with the system infos

0.4r2: march, 10th.
- Fixed a little fault, so now multi cpus get really used! (also it could solve some problems of infinite loops)

0.4: march, 9th.
- Implemented the use of all cpus (should give the multi cpu systems a big boost :> ), but just for linux yet
- Fixed the ration (%). It was not correct if you got a higher Score
- Fixed a Bug in the cpu info filtering
- Added some new parameters: '--fno-sys-info' , '--no-ref-info','--no-infos' and '--fno-threads'
- Fixed that in '--secure' mode the head of the table appears after the test( cause it should be before)
- Added some work arounds for unix systems
- Updated the reference system

0.3.4: march, 7th.
- Cleaned up the sysinfo class( so we could soon enhance it :> )
- Made a little change to the filtering of the cpu string
- Changed the makefile, so it works with the gentoo ebuild

0.3.3: march, 4th.
- Added the multithreading test for windows

0.3.2: march, 3rd.
- Added GCC info
- Updated the reference system
- Fixed a cpu info output problem (occurs on multi cpu systems )
- Made some change to the filtering of the cpu info string

0.3.1: march, 3rd.
- Filtered some useless stuff from the cpu info string
- Added a little work around for a compiling problem ( occurs under old Debians )
- Made a minor change on the reference system infos
- Changed the makefile

0.3: march, 3rd.
- Implemented the reference system, so your result gets compared immediately
- Needed to use the backup of Benchmark.cpp... so we lost the new multithreading test, some defines for windows and some cleaned up code :((
- Kicked out a linux only posix define( need to find something to replace it!)
- Little change on the stopwatch (to make a openbsd compiler happy)

0.2: march, 2nd.
- Added Multithreading tests
- Kicked out --fast-output
- Added and updated parameter
- made some cleanups
